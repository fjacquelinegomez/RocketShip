# RocketShip
Using four different methods from main, create four patterns using loops to create the shape of a rocket

I had to create a rocketship based off a picture given to my class, but I had to use a constant to be able to change the size of the rocket. I used four different methods to create each part of the rocket and when that worked I called all the functions from main.
